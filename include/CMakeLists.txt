# You might wonder why we don't simply add the list of header files to the check_deps

# The reason we can't do that is because cmake has built in rules that can't be disabled
# or overridden that prevent it from ever treating a file that ends in .h as a source file.
# So the work around for this problem is that we copy the header files to a different folder,
# one that's owned by CMake (the binary dir), and compile the header files there to perform
# the dependency checking.
