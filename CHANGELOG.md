## 7.0.0
* Added explicit destructor to clients. (#481)
* Fixed warnings. (#480)
* Added conversion function from `mqtt::qos` to `suback_return_code` and `v5::suback_reason_code`. (#478)
* Added boost::asio::ssl::context getter. Set `[[deprecated]]` attribute to wrapped function for boost::asio::ssl::context. They will be removed on verion 8.0.0. (#472)
  * mqtt_cpp is now separated from boost::asio::ssl::context detail.
* Fixed boost::type_erasure namespace. (#467)
* Refactoring. (#465)
* Improved receive packet processing. (#462)
* Fixed comments. (#454, #455)
* Added `constexpr`. (#451, #461)
* Use virtual function based polymorphism on endpoint receive packet processing. Existing APIs are preserved as `callable_overlay`. (#444)
  * Thanks to de-virtualization optimization, it is achieved zero-overhead.
* <<<< breaking change >>>> Updated `set_accept_handler()`'s parameter to shared_ptr of the endpoint. (#443)
* <<<< breaking change >>>> Updated `start_session()`'s parameter to `mqtt::any`. It only for life keeping purpose. (#442)

* <<<< breaking change >>>> Improved parameters of the publish handler. parsing `fixed_header` is no longer required. (#421)
* Replaced boost::asio deprecated API with new ones. (#419, 466)
* Set `[[deprecated]]` attribute to derecated variadic parameter version of suback/unsuback family. They will be removed on verion 8.0.0. (#417)
* Fixed BOOST_VERSION comparison typo. (#413)

* Added missing include. (#398)
* <<<< breaking change >>>> Introduced enum class instead of std::uint8_t. (#395, #397, #401, #414, #415, #438)
* Removed invalid WebSocket code from the test. (#394)
* <<<< breaking change >>>> Added subscribe_options class. (#387, #388, #393)
  * subscribe_options can be created from `std::uint8_t` so the impact of existing code is limited.
* <<<< breaking change >>>> Removed deprecated APIs. (#384)
